sproof networks
============

sproof currently runs on two networks. One is for production and one is for testing purposes.

Ethereum main chain
------------
:guilabel:`chainId=1`

sproof runs on the Ethereum mainchain. We use this `chainId` in our configuration files. Please note that you need to select a plan on the sproof Website (https://app.sproof.io) in order to interact with the main chain. You can choose a plan on the Settings page.

Ethereum Ropsten Testnet
------------
:guilabel:`chainId=3`

The Ropsten testnet is an Ethereum blockchain designed to test decentralized applications. You can use this testnet to submit transactions and to interact with the sproof network for free.
