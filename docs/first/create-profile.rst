============

Visit https://app.sproof.io to create your sproof profile.

sproof provides a free testnet (:doc:`network-sproof`) for developers. You can change the network in the settings page and also in all configuration files.

Backup your sproof-code
------------
Please note, that it is very important that you will download and backup your sproof-code. You can export your sproof-code in the settings page.

Verify your website
------------
You need to enter your website in the onboarding phase. In order to verify that you are in control of this domain, you need to upload a file to your webserver, which has to be accessable under your root domain. You will find more instructions on the web app.

This process is necessary to provide additional evidence that you are the expected organisation.

Confirm other profiles
------------
Confirming other sproof profiles would help the sproof community to build a strong confirmation network.
