Create your sproof profile
============

In order to use the sproof infrastructure, a profile is required. Creating a profile is simple and consists of the following steps:

Create a new account
------------
Visit https://app.sproof.io/#/signup to create your account. Each account will be associated with a profile.

Back up your sproof-code
------------
Export your ``sproof-code`` in the Settings page (https://app.sproof.io/#/settings/) after signup. Please note that it is **very** important that you download and back up your ``sproof-code``. It cannot be replaced or restored if it gets lost, unless you (the account owner) have a backup of it.

Verify your Website (recommended)
------------
You need to enter your Website in the signup phase. In order to verify that you are in control of its domain, you need to upload a file to your Web server, which is accessible under your root domain. You can find more detailed instructions on the Web app.

This process is necessary to provide additional evidence that you are in fact the organisation you created the profile for. It also helps others to trust and confirm your identity (see below). Your identity is linked to your profile.

Confirm other profiles (recommended)
------------
Now that your identity is verified, you can confirm other profiles in the sproof network and other profiles can confirm yours. Confirming other sproof profiles helps the sproof community to build a strong network of profiles trusting each other. This helps every user of the sproof network to judge the authenticity of profiles. A profile with a verified Website that is confirmed by another profile with a verified Website is more likely to be trusted by a user if the user knows either profile and/or their Website.

Get started
------------

You are now ready to get started and use sproof. sproof provides a free testnet (:doc:`network-sproof`) for developers for testing purposes. You can change the network in the Settings page (https://app.sproof.io/#/settings/) as well as in all configuration files.

Regardless of whether you just want to test sproof or integrate it right away, you can find your next steps here: :doc:`integrate-sproof`.
