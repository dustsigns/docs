Visit https://app.sproof.io to create your sproof profile.

sproof provides a free testnet (:doc:`network-sproof`) for developers. You can change the network in the Settings page as well as in all configuration files.

Back up your sproof-code
------------
Please note that it is very important that you download and back up your ``sproof-code``. You can export your ``sproof-code`` in the Settings page.

Verify your Website
------------
You need to enter your Website in the onboarding phase. In order to verify that you are in control of this domain, you need to upload a file to your Web server, which has to be accessible under your root domain. You will find more detailed instructions on the Web app.

This process is necessary to provide additional evidence that you are in fact the organisation you created the profile for.

Confirm other profiles
------------
Confirming other sproof profiles helps the sproof community to build a strong confirmation network.
